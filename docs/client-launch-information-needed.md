## QA And Signoff Contacts

Ask the client to identify:

- Person responsible for approving allergen tags.
- Person responsible for approving email wording.
- Person responsible for approving production test orders.
- Person who should receive launch-day issue reports.

## Suggested Client Message

Use or adapt this message:

```text
We are ready for the final launch-prep phase. The app is functionally built and has passed local validation, but production launch is blocked until we receive the final production environment details, email sending information, upload/storage decision, launch menu data, payment instructions, policy copy, and admin account details.

Please review the attached launch information list and send the launch-blocking items first. Brand/content polish items can follow separately if needed.
```

## Internal Notes

- Do not use the local development database as production.
- Do not enable live email until the client approves the sender address and first live-send test.
- Do not allow local production uploads unless the client accepts the durability risk or the host guarantees persistent shared storage.
- Do not enable automated Square/PayPal checkout unless the client approves a dedicated future payment integration phase. Manual Square/PayPal payment links or invoices are acceptable for launch.
- Keep Catering and Personal Chef as service request workflows, not checkout products.
- Do not interpret the internally stored fulfillment datetime as a customer promise. When no public fulfillment time is configured, customer pages and emails must show the approved message and never expose a fallback such as `12:00 PM`.
- Use `npm run db:seed-demo` only for local, demo, staging, or disposable rehearsal databases. Do not run it against real production customer data unless the demo catalog is intentionally desired.
