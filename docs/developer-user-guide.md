# Chef Rah's Twisted Kitchen Developer User Guide

Last updated: July 14, 2026

This guide covers local setup, database maintenance, validation, launch rules, and production deployment for the current application. Use `docs/production-runbook.md` as the final production checklist and `docs/fresh-db-deployment-rehearsal.md` for a full rehearsal record.

## 1. Project Overview

Chef Rah's Twisted Kitchen is a Next.js food-service application with:

- Standard menu, plate, dessert, and a la carte ordering.
- Build Your Weekly Plan packages with required meal slots and per-slot options.
- True guest checkout and registered customer checkout.
- Owner/admin order, kitchen, menu, customer, report, and settings tools.
- Catering and personal-chef request workflows.
- Transactional email through Resend and React Email.
- Manual/offline payment tracking for launch.

The server is authoritative for prices, fees, weekly windows, option upcharges, user ownership, and fulfillment scheduling. Do not move these decisions to client-only code.

## 2. Tech Stack

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Database ORM | Prisma |
| Production database | MySQL/MariaDB through `@prisma/adapter-mariadb` |
| Authentication | Auth.js / NextAuth credentials provider with Prisma adapter |
| Email delivery | Resend |
| Email templates | React Email |
| Client cart state | Zustand |

This repository uses Next.js 16.2.10. Before changing Next.js APIs or conventions, follow `AGENTS.md` and read the relevant installed guide under `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.

## 3. Local Setup

Use Node.js 24 LTS for local work and production builds. Node.js Current releases such as Node 26 are not the production recommendation unless the complete toolchain has been explicitly verified. Under Node 26, builds may emit a `DEP0205` warning from `@tailwindcss/node` using `module.register()`; that observed warning comes from the dependency/toolchain, not application code.

PowerShell setup:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PSButlerII/chef-rahs-twisted-kitchen.git
Set-Location chef-rahs-twisted-kitchen
npm ci
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with local-only values. Do not commit secrets, production credentials, or a real customer database URL.

Minimum local setup requires:

- A reachable MySQL/MariaDB database.
- Matching local values for `AUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- A stable `AUTH_SECRET` that does not change while testing existing browser sessions.
- `EMAIL_DRY_RUN=true` unless intentionally running a controlled live email test.

## 4. Database Setup

### Disposable Docker MariaDB Rehearsal

This command creates a disposable local MariaDB container on port `3307`. The sample credentials are local test values only.

```powershell
docker run --name chef-rahs-mariadb-rehearsal `
  --detach `
  --publish 3307:3306 `
  --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=local-root-password `
  --env MARIADB_DATABASE=chef_rahs_rehearsal `
  --env MARIADB_USER=chef_rahs `
  --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=local-dev-password `
  mariadb:11.4
```

Set the matching local URL:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "mysql://chef_rahs:local-dev-password@127.0.0.1:3307/chef_rahs_rehearsal"
```

If a username or password contains URL-special characters, URL-encode it before placing it in `DATABASE_URL`.

### Prisma Commands

Generate the client and apply the committed migrations:

```powershell
npm run prisma:generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Use `migrate deploy` for fresh rehearsals and production. Do not use `prisma migrate dev` in production.

Run the production-safe foundation seed when the target database needs the baseline allergens and BusinessSettings:

```powershell
npx prisma db seed
```

For local, demo, staging, or a disposable rehearsal database, the demo seed adds showcase users, menu data, weekly packages, offerings, options, and launch scheduling defaults:

```powershell
npm run db:seed-demo
```

Do not run `npm run db:seed-demo` against a real production customer database unless the owner intentionally wants the demo catalog and understands that the script recreates demo weekly records.

## 5. Environment Variables

Start from `.env.example`.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | MySQL-compatible Prisma URL: `mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:3306/DATABASE`. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Auth.js signing/encryption secret. Use a strong, stable value. |
| `AUTH_URL` | Canonical Auth.js origin. Local default is `http://localhost:3000`; production is `https://rahstwistedkitchen.com`. |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Compatibility Auth.js origin; keep it aligned with `AUTH_URL`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public application origin used for links and email assets. |
| `BUSINESS_TIME_ZONE` | Business-local scheduling zone, expected to be `America/New_York` for launch. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key used only when live sending is enabled. |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | Verified sender name/address used by transactional email. |
| `EMAIL_DRY_RUN` | `true` logs/renders without sending; `false` permits live Resend delivery. |
| `EMAIL_PREVIEW_FILES` | Enables local preview file output when supported by the email utility. Keep it `false` in production unless intentionally debugging. |
| `ALLOW_LOCAL_UPLOADS_IN_PRODUCTION` | Keep `false` or unset for launch; local production uploads are not durable. |
| `OWNER_EMAIL` | Existing registered user's email for the one-time owner bootstrap. It is never a user-creation input. |
| `OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | Temporary long random secret for `POST /api/setup/promote-owner` when the host has no console. Remove it and restart/redeploy immediately after success. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Legacy single-user input for `npm run admin:promote`. Not needed for owner-managed admins. |
| `ADMIN_ROLE` | Legacy role for `npm run admin:promote`; defaults to `ADMIN`. |

Legacy Stripe placeholders may remain blank while the existing env parser supports them. Stripe is not the selected launch payment integration. Square and PayPal are not integrated in this release.

## 6. Owner And Admin Setup

The application does not create privileged users from environment variables.

1. Start or deploy the app.
2. Register the first owner normally through `/register`.
3. Set `OWNER_EMAIL` to that exact registered email.
4. If the host has console access, run:

```powershell
npm run owner:promote
```

   If the host has no console, temporarily set a random `OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` of at least 32 characters, restart/redeploy, and call the POST-only endpoint:

```powershell
$headers = @{
  "x-owner-bootstrap-token" = $env:OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
}

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Method Post `
  -Uri "https://rahstwistedkitchen.com/api/setup/promote-owner" `
  -Headers $headers
```

   Remove `OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` and restart/redeploy immediately after the successful response. The endpoint then becomes unavailable.

5. Sign out, sign back in as the owner, and open `/admin/role-manager`.
6. Have additional staff register normally with their own passwords.
7. Assign those registered users the `ADMIN` role in Role Manager.

`OWNER` has all normal admin access plus role management. `ADMIN` has normal admin access but cannot open the role page or call its mutation API. Last-owner protection prevents the final owner from being demoted. Successful changes are audited.

Neither bootstrap method creates users or passwords, and neither reads or updates `User.passwordHash`. Do not create fake users, passwordless users, temporary admin passwords, or users solely to satisfy an environment variable. Do not use email matching to attach guest orders to registered users.

## 7. Running The App

Development:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Production build and local production start:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

The default origin is `http://localhost:3000`. When using another port, update all three local URL variables so Auth.js redirects and generated links use the same origin.

## 8. Validation Commands

For a clean production-style validation on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run prisma:generate
npm run check
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
git diff --check
npx tsx scripts/qa-late-fee-rules.ts
npm run db:seed-demo
```

Notes:

- `npm run check` runs ESLint, Prisma generation, Next route type generation, TypeScript, and a production build.
- The separate build and `tsc` commands are still useful final deployment checks.
- The QA script validates the weekly open, late-fee, close, and fixed Sunday fulfillment rules.
- The demo seed changes the configured database. Run it only against cleanup-safe data.

## 9. TypeScript And Hostinger Notes

`tsconfig.json` intentionally has:

```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "noImplicitAny": true
}
```

Do not weaken strictness, add `ignoreBuildErrors`, or hide production errors with `ts-ignore`. Prefer explicit data shapes and null guards, particularly around BusinessSettings, weekly period schedules, guest `userId`, email `orderUrl`, and order fulfillment display.

Next.js generated types under `.next` can become stale after route changes or interrupted development builds. If generated route or validator files report malformed or impossible errors, stop the dev server, remove `.next`, regenerate, and rerun the full validation sequence.

## 10. Current Launch Business Rules

- Global customer-selected checkout scheduling is disabled.
- Checkout does not show Requested Date or Requested Time while scheduling is disabled.
- The server stores a trusted internal fulfillment datetime when required, but that fallback time is not a customer promise.
- No exact delivery time is promised.
- Weekly fulfillment copy is: "Weekly meal plan orders are delivered on Sunday. You will be notified when delivery is scheduled."
- Weekly menus are posted and ordering opens Wednesday.
- Weekly ordering remains open through Friday.
- The configured late fee applies from Friday at 5:00 PM through Friday at 10:00 PM.
- Weekly ordering closes Friday at 10:00 PM; later orders are rejected for that period.
- Weekly fulfillment is Sunday.

BusinessSettings provide global defaults, and WeeklyMenuPeriod stores resolved dates for each published period. The order API remains the source of truth.

## 11. Weekly Meal Plan Behavior

- A package requires `days * mealsPerDay` customer selections.
- Each slot stores its day index, meal index, readable label snapshot, weekly offering, and selected option records as permanent order data.
- Package slot labels can be Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, or the position-specific generic Meal label.
- The demo 5-Day / 3 Meals package uses Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner and is marked Requires chef approval; customers see `By request`.
- Seasonal is a separate package flag.
- Breakfast-only offerings appear only in slots labeled Breakfast and are also validated server-side.
- Selected slot options are validated against the selected offering and period.
- Option upcharges are recomputed server-side and added to the base package price.
- Stale, unavailable, unpublished, expired, wrong-period, and incomplete selections are rejected.
- Fixed weekly scheduling stores the server-resolved Sunday fulfillment datetime and displays the configured message without exposing an internal fallback time.

## 12. Guest Checkout Behavior

- Guest orders are real orders with `Order.userId = null`.
- Guests provide name, email, phone, and delivery/contact details required by the selected fulfillment type.
- The API does not create a user and does not auto-attach a guest order by matching email.
- Confirmation email goes to `order.customerEmail`.
- Guests land on the public `/checkout/thank-you` flow rather than a protected order detail page.
- Guest emails do not include account-only order links.
- Account order pages remain login-only and query by the authenticated user.
- Logged-in orders continue to link to the authenticated user and appear in account history.
- Admin order list/detail pages display guest orders, including a Guest badge.

## 13. Email Testing

### Phase 1: Dry Run

Use:

```powershell
$env:EMAIL_DRY_RUN = "true"
$env:EMAIL_PREVIEW_FILES = "true"
```

Trigger order confirmation, approval, payment received, and service-request paths. Confirm the expected recipient and subject in logs or preview files. This validates app-side rendering and triggers only; it does not validate Resend delivery.

### Phase 2: Controlled Live Resend Delivery

After the sender domain and DNS are verified:

1. Use an internal/test recipient only.
2. Set `EMAIL_DRY_RUN=false` temporarily.
3. Submit an internal order and trigger approval/payment email where applicable.
4. Confirm inbox delivery and check spam/promotions if needed.
5. Return `EMAIL_DRY_RUN` to `true` if more non-live QA remains.

Set `EMAIL_DRY_RUN=false` for launch only after controlled live delivery passes and the team is ready for customer-facing emails.

## 14. Fresh Database Rehearsal

Use a fresh, disposable MySQL/MariaDB database and production-shaped non-secret values.

1. Start the Docker MariaDB container or provision an empty rehearsal database.
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` and the required application/email variables.
3. Run `npm ci` from the repository root.
4. Run `npm run prisma:generate`.
5. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
6. Run `npx prisma db seed` for foundation data.
7. Optionally run `npm run db:seed-demo` only on the disposable rehearsal database.
8. Review BusinessSettings, especially disabled scheduling, blank public times, Wednesday open, Friday 5:00 PM late fee, Friday 10:00 PM close, and Sunday fulfillment.
9. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start`.
10. Register and bootstrap the first owner.
11. Run guest pickup, guest delivery, guest weekly, logged-in, admin, kitchen, email dry-run, breakfast filtering, option upcharge, past-date, and weekend smoke tests.
12. Complete the controlled live internal Resend test before launch approval.

See `docs/fresh-db-deployment-rehearsal.md` for the detailed checklist and migration inventory.

## 15. Common Troubleshooting

### `EADDRINUSE` On Port 3000

Another process is already listening on the port. Stop the known local dev process, or run on another port:

```powershell
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

When changing ports, update `AUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the same origin.

### Auth.js `no matching decryption secret`

Confirm every running app process uses the same `AUTH_SECRET`. Stop stale servers, restart the app, and clear the local site's auth cookies after intentionally changing the secret. Never rotate the production secret casually because existing sessions depend on it.

### Windows `EPERM` On A Locked Node Modules Or SWC File

Stop the running Next.js/Node process that owns the file and close tools actively scanning it. Identify the relevant process before using `Stop-Process`. Then rerun `npm ci` or the failed build command. Do not edit generated dependency files.

### Stale `.next` Route Or Validator Errors

Stop the dev server and run:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run check
```

Do not commit `.next` or hand-edit generated route types.

### `npm ci` Cannot Find The Lockfile

Run the command from the repository root, where `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are located. `npm ci` intentionally requires the lockfile and should not be replaced with an unreviewed dependency update during deployment.

## 16. Deployment Notes

The current production path is Hostinger with MySQL/MariaDB and Node.js 24 LTS.

Recommended deployment order:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run prisma:generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
npm run build
```

Then start/deploy the built app, register the first owner, use either `npm run owner:promote` or the temporary-token endpoint, configure Resend, and complete production smoke tests. On a host without console access, remove `OWNER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` and restart/redeploy before normal production operation.

Production rules:

- Use `npx prisma migrate deploy`; never use `prisma migrate dev` in production.
- Review foundation seed behavior before running it on an existing database.
- Do not run the demo seed against real customer data unless explicitly intended.
- Keep `ALLOW_LOCAL_UPLOADS_IN_PRODUCTION=false` or unset until durable object storage is approved.
- Keep local email preview routes and preview files out of the production workflow.
- Run `npm run env:check` with final live values before launch approval.
- Keep automated online checkout disabled until a selected provider has a dedicated, reviewed integration.

## 17. Future Developer Notes

- Square and PayPal are selected for a future automated payment phase. Launch uses manual links, invoices, and offline payment tracking; do not claim either provider is integrated.
- Tokenized guest order tracking and public guest order detail links are future scope. Guest thank-you and email flows must not expose protected order data.
- Durable upload/object storage remains a production decision. Local filesystem uploads are not a durable hosting strategy.
- SMS/customer scheduling notifications may be added later; the current fulfillment message says the owner will notify the customer when delivery is scheduled.
